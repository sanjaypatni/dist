Here are some of the top tools you can use to help in curating successful content:
* Feedly: Feedly helps you stay on top of the latest trending topics and curate blog content to use for posts or to give you ideas for content you could create yourself.
* Pinterest: Pinterest is a great tool for keeping up with useful tricks and tips you can use as you create your own content. You can save ideas to private boards to refer to later. It's also a great way to find blog content to share, especially since you can see the number of times it's been pinned on Pinterest and can make an educated guess about whether it will be well-received with your own audience.
* Trap!t: This is an "intelligent" tool that gets smarter the more you use it for content curation. You can distribute your curated content across all social platforms.
* ScoopIt: This tool allows you to search for content by keyword and share directly to your social networks.
* BuzzSumo: This tool keeps you updated with the latest trending topics, allowing you to find content by topic and share it directly from a dashboard.
* Twitter lists: Twitter lists allow you to add influencers, news websites and companies to a list so you can quickly browse any content shared by anyone on the list.
